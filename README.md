This is a Python script for implementing a Boolean Retrieval Model for searching through a collection of research papers. It provides functionality for boolean query processing, proximity query processing, and inverted index creation.

## Features

- Boolean Query Processing: Allows users to perform boolean queries using AND, OR, and NOT operators.
- Proximity Query Processing: Supports proximity queries to find documents where two terms appear within a specified distance of each other.
- Inverted Index Creation: Automatically creates an inverted index from a collection of research papers.

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script
2. Select the query type (Boolean or Proximity).
3. Enter the directory path containing the research papers.
4. Enter your query (Boolean or Proximity).
5. Click the "Perform Query" button to see the results.
